        <h2>How I Found Web Dev</h2>
        <p>
          After a year of the Computer Information Systems Program at UFV, I knew I had found my
          passion. Web Development. It started out as just a hobby as UFV taught me a lot more about
          hardware than they did software. During this year I focused a lot of my attention on my
          foundational programming skills by myself. This is why I consider myself to be a Self
          Taught Web Developer.

        <h2>Learning by Building</h2>
        <p>
          I would identify myself as a Self Taught Developer. However, I have found that learning
          through tutorials is not a productive way to grow as a developer. Instead, I have spent a
          lot of time improving on my ability to effectively read documentation to solve problems
          when I run into them. I firmly believe that in order to grow in this industry, you need to
          jump right into the action and start building.
