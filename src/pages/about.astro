          <h2>How I Found Web Dev</h2>
          <p>
            After a year of the Computer Information Systems Program at UFV, I knew I had found my
            passion. Web Development. It started out as just a hobby as UFV taught me a lot more
            about hardware than they did software. During this year I focused a lot of my attention
            on my foundational programming skills by myself. This is why I consider myself to be a
            Self Taught Web Developer.

          <h2>Learning by Building</h2>
          <p>
            I would identify myself as a Self Taught Developer. However, I have found that learning
            through tutorials is not a productive way to grow as a developer. Instead, I have spent
            a lot of time improving on my ability to effectively read documentation to solve
            problems when I run into them. I firmly believe that in order to grow in this industry,
            you need to jump right into the action and start building.
